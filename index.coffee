# # in JS
# options = {

# i think we will need some nice lib to work with times in JS that respect zones (i use `moment` now, but itâ€™s a bit old and bloated)

export default class DatetimeDistanceInWords
  constructor: (element, options) ->
    @element = element
    @options = options

  works: -> "YES!"
